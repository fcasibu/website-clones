Too bloated and could've done much better with lesser lines of code.

There's a lot of times where I could've just created one class for multiple elements but my brain is too smooth to notice them when you're hyperocused, only noticing them when it's done. This is also something I should learn and practice. Still need to work on a lot of thing like positioning layout, usage of clip-path, sizing, transition, etc.

I'm also practicing my usage of colors. Using a different color scheme than the original website.
