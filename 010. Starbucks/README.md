Layouts, animations, and DOM manipulation are my weaknesses right now. For DOM manipulation, I kind of hard coded the carousel. CSS animation is definitely the hardest for me though, I really enjoyed making it, but at the same time dreaded the fact that it took so much time creating one simple animation.
