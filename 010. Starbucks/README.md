Layouts, animations, and DOM manipulation are my weaknesses right now. For DOM manipulation, I kind of hard coded the carousel. CSS animation is definitely the hardest for me though, I really enjoyed making it, but at the same time dreaded the fact that it took so much time creating one simple animation.

After finishing the landing page and started doing the next page. It seems like I've crashed into a wall all of a sudden. It suddenly dawned on me, just how bad I structured everything. Especially classes, I didn't think of it too much, but when creating multi-page websites, I guess structuring and planning things first before implementing something is very important. My stylesheet is cluttered, I definitely won't be able to find immediately what I wanted to find.

I learned a lot and will try to gradually change my behaviors one by one.
